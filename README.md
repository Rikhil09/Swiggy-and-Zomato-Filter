# Swiggy-and-Zomato-Filter
This is a web application that allows users to filter restaurant data based on city, price range, and whether the food is vegetarian or non-vegetarian. The project showcases a basic example of how to work with JSON data, apply filters, and display results dynamically using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Filter by City**: Allows users to select a city from a dropdown menu to view restaurants located in that city.
- **Filter by Price Range**: Allows users to filter menu items within restaurants based on selected price ranges (e.g., 0-200, 200-300, 300-500).
- **Filter by Veg/Non-Veg**: Allows users to filter menu items based on whether they are vegetarian or non-vegetarian.
- **Display Results**: Dynamically displays filtered restaurant details and their corresponding menu items.

## Technologies

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching and filtering the data, and updating the DOM dynamically.
